        <h1>3.What is event loop? How does work it?</h1>
        <h3>
            <p><span style="color: red;">Event Loop:</span> An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue
                and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function stack becomes empty.</p>
            <p><span style="color: red;">Working Process:</span> An event loop is an endless loop, which waits for
                tasks, executes them, and then sleeps until it receives more tasks. The event loop executes tasks from
                the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task. The event loop allows
                us to use callbacks and promises.</p>
